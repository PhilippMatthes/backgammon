   * Bar: 0
   *
   * A positive integer represents the number of PLAYER_BELOW's
   * checkers on a particular point; the absolute value of negative
   * numbers stands for the number of PLAYER_ABOVE's checkers.
   *
   * Note, that there can never be points with checkers from both
   * players at the same time! However, this is different for the
   * two pseudo positions POS_BAR and POS_OFF.
   *
   * POS_BAR stands for the bar. As both players may have checkers
   * on the bar at some point, the coding is a little bit more complex
   * here: PLAYER_BELOW's checkers are stored in the lower two decimal
   * places, whereas the fourth and third digit are used for PLAYER_ABOVE.
   * So the (decimal!) number '103' stands for a situation where
   * PLAYER_BELOW has 3 checkers on the bar and PLAYER_ABOVE has 1 checker
   * on the bar. You may want to use the accessor functions defined below.
   *
   * Usually there is no need to consider POS_OFF at all. It represents
   * all checkers that have already been beared off. The value stored in
   * POS_OFF is simply the sum of all checkers that left the board, i.e.
   * if PLAYER_BELOW beared off one checker and PLAYER_ABOVE beared off
   * three checkers POS_OFF will hold a value of 1 + (-3) = -2
